# Terms of Use

Welcome to VoceSpace. Please read on to learn the rules and restrictions that govern your use of our website(s), products, services and applications, which include, but are not limited to, VoceSpace.com (the "Services"). If you have any questions, comments, or concerns regarding these terms or the Services, please contact us at [han@privoce.com](mailto:han@privoce.com).

These Terms of Use (the “Terms”) are a binding contract between you and Privoce, Inc. ("Privoce," "we" and "us"). You must agree to and accept all of the Terms, or you don’t have the right to use the Services. Your use of the Services in any way means that you agree to all of these Terms, and these Terms will remain in effect while you use the Services. These Terms include the provisions in this document, as well as those in the (Privacy Policy).

## [WILL THESE TERMS EVER CHANGE?](#changes)

We are constantly trying to improve our Services, so these Terms may need to change along with the Services. We reserve the right to change the Terms at any time, but if we do, we will bring it to your attention by placing a notice on the VoceSpace website, by sending you an email, and/or by some other means.

If you don’t agree with the new Terms, you are free to reject them; unfortunately, that means you will no longer be able to use the Services. If you use the Services in any way after a change to the Terms is effective, that means you agree to all of the changes.

Except for changes by us as described here, no other amendment or modification of these Terms will be effective unless in writing and signed by both you and us.

## [WHAT ABOUT MY PRIVACY?](#privacy)

VoceSpace takes the privacy of its users very seriously. Please refer to the current VoceSpace Privacy Policy.

The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA") requires that online service providers obtain parental consent before they knowingly collect personally identifiable information online from children who are under 13. We do not knowingly collect or solicit personally identifiable information from children under 13; if you are a child under 13, please do not attempt to register for the Services or send any personal information about yourself to us. If we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under 13, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that a child under 13 may have provided us personal information, please contact us at han@privoce.com

## [WHAT ARE THE BASICS OF USING THE SERVICES?](#basics)

You may be required to sign up for an account, and select a password and user name (“User ID”). You promise to provide us with accurate, complete, and updated registration information about yourself. For your User ID, you may not select a name that you do not have the right to use, or another person’s name with the intent to impersonate that person. You may not transfer your account to anyone else without our prior written permission. You represent and warrant that you are of legal age to form a binding contract (or if not, you’ve received your parent’s or guardian’s permission to use the Services and gotten your parent or guardian to agree to these Terms on your behalf). If you’re agreeing to these Terms on behalf of an organization or entity, you represent and warrant that you are authorized to agree to these Terms on that organization or entity’s behalf and bind them to these Terms (in which case, the references to “you” and “your” in these Terms, except for in this sentence, refer to that organization or entity). You will only use the Services for your own personal or business use and only in a manner that complies with all laws that apply to you. If applicable laws prohibit your use of the Services, then you aren’t authorized to use the Services. We can’t and won’t be responsible for your use of the Services in a way that breaks the law. You will not share your account or password with anyone, and you must protect the security of your account and your password. You are responsible for any activity associated with your account.

## [Your use of the Services is subject to the following additional restrictions:](#restrictions)

You represent, warrant, and agree that you will not contribute any Content or User Submission (each of those terms is defined below) or otherwise use the Services or interact with the Services in a manner that: Infringes or violates the intellectual property rights or any other rights of anyone else (including VoceSpace);

1. Violates any law or regulation;
2. Is harmful, fraudulent, deceptive, threatening, harassing, defamatory, obscene, or otherwise objectionable;
3. Jeopardizes the security of your VoceSpace account or anyone else’s (such as allowing someone else to log in to the Services as you);
4. Attempts, in any manner, to obtain the password, account, or other security information from any other user;
5. Violates the security of any computer network, or cracks any passwords or security encryption codes;
6. Runs Maillist, Listserv, any form of auto-responder or “spam” on the Services, or any processes that run or are activated while you are not logged into the Services, or that otherwise interfere with the proper working of the Services (including by placing an unreasonable load on the Services’ infrastructure);
7. Uses any intellectual property rights protected by applicable laws and contained in or accessible through the Services for the purpose of building a competitive product or service or copying its features or user interface;
8. Uses the Services, or permits it to be used, for purposes of product benchmarking or other comparative analysis intended for publication without VoceSpace’s prior written consent;
9. Uses the Services to develop or enhance any software, software code, or any derivative works of any software without VoceSpace's prior written consent;
10. Uses the Services as a direct competitor of VoceSpace or for the purpose of monitoring the Services’ availability, performance, functionality or for any other benchmarking or competitive purposes;
11. "Crawls," "scrapes," or "spiders" any page, data, or portion of or relating to the Services or Content (through use of manual or automated means);
12. Copies or stores any significant portion of the Content;
13. Decompiles, reverse engineers, or otherwise attempts to obtain the source code or underlying ideas or information of or relating to the Services.

A violation of any of the foregoing is grounds for termination of your right to use or access the Services.

## [WHAT ARE MY RIGHTS IN THE SERVICES?](#rights)

The materials displayed or performed or available on or through the Services, including, but not limited to, text, graphics, data, articles, photos, images, illustrations, User Submissions, and so forth (all of the foregoing, the “Content”) are protected by copyright and/or other intellectual property laws. You promise to abide by all copyright notices, trademark rules, information, and restrictions contained in any Content you access through the Services, and you won’t use, copy, reproduce, modify, translate, publish, broadcast, transmit, distribute, perform, upload, display, license, sell or otherwise exploit for any purpose any Content not owned by you, (i) without the prior consent of the owner of that Content or (ii) in a way that violates someone else’s (including VoceSpace’s) rights.

You understand that we owns the Services. You won’t modify, publish, transmit, participate in the transfer or sale of, reproduce (except as expressly provided in this Section), creative derivative works based on, or otherwise exploit any of the Services.

The Services may allow you to copy or download certain Content; please remember that just because this functionality exists, doesn’t mean that all the restrictions above don’t apply – they do!

## [WHO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR WHAT I SEE AND DO ON THE SERVICES?](#responsibility)

Any information or content publicly posted or privately transmitted through the Services is the sole responsibility of the person from whom such content originated, and you access all such information and content at your own risk, and we aren’t liable for any errors or omissions in that information or content or for any damages or loss you might suffer in connection with it. We cannot control and have no duty to take any action regarding how you may interpret and use the Content or what actions you may take as a result of having been exposed to the Content, and you hereby release us from all liability for you having acquired or not acquired Content through the Services. We can’t guarantee the identity of any users with whom you interact in using the Services and are not responsible for which users gain access to the Services.

You are responsible for all Content you contribute, in any manner, to the Services, and you represent and warrant you have all rights necessary to do so, in the manner in which you contribute it. You will keep all your registration information accurate and current. You are responsible for all your activity in connection with the Services.

The Services may contain links or connections to third party websites or services that are not owned or controlled by us. When you access third party websites or use third party services, you accept that there are risks in doing so, and that VoceSpace is not responsible for such risks. We encourage you to be aware when you leave the Services and to read the terms and conditions and privacy policy of each third party website or service that you visit or utilize. VoceSpace has no control over, and assumes no responsibility for, the content, accuracy, privacy policies, or practices of or opinions expressed in any third party websites or by any third party that you interact with through the Services. In addition, VoceSpace will not and cannot monitor, verify, censor or edit the content of any third party site or service. By using the Services, you release and hold us harmless from any and all liability arising from your use of any third party website or service.

Your interactions with organizations and/or individuals found on or through the Services, including payment and delivery of goods or services, and any other terms, conditions, warranties or representations associated with such dealings, are solely between you and such organizations and/or individuals. You should make whatever investigation you feel necessary or appropriate before proceeding with any online or offline transaction with any of these third parties. You agree that VoceSpace shall not be responsible or liable for any loss or damage of any sort incurred as the result of any such dealings.

If there is a dispute between participants on this site, or between users and any third party, you agree that VoceSpace is under no obligation to become involved. In the event that you have a dispute with one or more other users, you release VoceSpace, its officers, employees, agents, and successors from claims, demands, and damages of every kind or nature, known or unknown, suspected or unsuspected, disclosed or undisclosed, arising out of or in any way related to such disputes and/or our Services. If you are a California resident, you shall and hereby do waive California Civil Code Section 1542, which says: "A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which, if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor."

## [WILL VoceSpace EVER CHANGE THE SERVICES?](#service-changes)

We’re always trying to improve the Services, so they may change over time. We may suspend or discontinue any part of the Services, or we may introduce new features or impose limits on certain features or restrict access to parts or all of the Services. We’ll try to give you notice when we make a material change to the Services that would adversely affect you, but this isn’t always practical. Similarly, we reserve the right to remove any Content from the Services at any time, for any reason (including, but not limited to, if someone alleges you contributed that Content in violation of these Terms), in our sole discretion, and without notice.

## [DO THE SERVICES COST ANYTHING?](#costs)

Some of the VoceSpace Services are currently free, but we reserve the right to charge for certain or all Services in the future. We will notify you before any Services you are currently using begin carrying a fee, and if you wish to continue using such Services, you must pay all applicable fees for such Services.

If you choose to sign up for any Services that carry a fee (the “Paid Services”) you will be charged the then current fees for such Paid Services. Unless otherwise agreed, all fees paid to VoceSpace are non-refundable.

## [WHAT IF I WANT TO STOP USING THE SERVICES?](#termination)

You’re free to do that at any time, by contacting us at han@privoce.com, please refer to our Privacy Policy, as well as the licenses above, to understand how we treat information you provide to us after you have stopped using our Services.

VoceSpace is also free to terminate (or suspend access to) your use of the Services or your account, for any reason in our discretion, including your breach of these Terms. VoceSpace has the sole right to decide whether you are in violation of any of the restrictions set forth in these Terms.

Account termination may result in destruction of any Content associated with your account, so keep that in mind before you decide to terminate your account. We will try to provide advance notice to you prior to our terminating your account so that you are able to retrieve any important User Submissions you may have stored in your account (to the extent allowed by law and these Terms), but we may not do so if we determine it would be impractical, illegal, not in the interest of someone’s safety or security, or otherwise harmful to the rights or property of ours.

If you have deleted your account by mistake, contact us immediately at han@privoce.com – we will try to help, but unfortunately, we can’t promise that we can recover or restore anything.

Provisions that, by their nature, should survive termination of these Terms shall survive termination. By way of example, all of the following will survive termination: any obligation you have to pay us or indemnify us, any limitations on our liability, any terms regarding ownership or intellectual property rights, and terms regarding disputes between us.

## [WHAT ELSE DO I NEED TO KNOW?](#legal)

SOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF CERTAIN DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION AND EXCLUSIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

**Indemnity.** To the fullest extent allowed by applicable law, You agree to indemnify and hold VoceSpace, its affiliates, officers, agents, employees, and partners harmless from and against any and all claims, liabilities, damages (actual and consequential), losses and expenses (including attorneys’ fees) arising from or in any way related to any third party claims relating to (a) your use of the Services (including any actions taken by a third party using your account), and (b) your violation of these Terms. In the event of such a claim, suit, or action (“Claim”), we will attempt to provide notice of the Claim to the contact information we have for your account (provided that failure to deliver such notice shall not eliminate or reduce your indemnification obligations hereunder.

**Assignment.** You may not assign, delegate or transfer these Terms or your rights or obligations hereunder, or your Services account, in any way (by operation of law or otherwise) without VoceSpace’s prior written consent. We may transfer, assign, or delegate these Terms and our rights and obligations without consent.

**Choice of Law; Arbitration.** These Terms are governed by and will be construed under the laws of the State of California, without regard to the conflicts of laws provisions thereof. Any dispute arising from or relating to the subject matter of these Terms shall be finally settled in San Francisco County, California, in English, in accordance with the Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures of Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services, Inc. ("JAMS") then in effect, by one commercial arbitrator with substantial experience in resolving intellectual property and commercial contract disputes, who shall be selected from the appropriate list of JAMS arbitrators in accordance with such Rules. Judgment upon the award rendered by such arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. Notwithstanding the foregoing obligation to arbitrate disputes, each party shall have the right to pursue injunctive or other equitable relief at any time, from any court of competent jurisdiction. For all purposes of this Agreement, the parties consent to exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the state or federal courts located in, respectively, San Francisco County, California, or the Northern District of California.

**Miscellaneous.** You will be responsible for paying, withholding, filing, and reporting all taxes, duties, and other governmental assessments associated with your activity in connection with the Services, provided that VoceSpace may, in its sole discretion, do any of the foregoing on your behalf or for itself as it sees fit. The failure of either you or us to exercise, in any way, any right herein shall not be deemed a waiver of any further rights hereunder. If any provision of these Terms is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision will be limited or eliminated, to the minimum extent necessary, so that these Terms shall otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable. You and VoceSpace agree that these Terms are the complete and exclusive statement of the mutual understanding between you and VoceSpace, and that it supersedes and cancels all previous written and oral agreements, communications and other understandings relating to the subject matter of these Terms, and that all modifications to these Terms must be in a writing signed by both parties (except as otherwise provided herein). No agency, partnership, joint venture, or employment is created as a result of these Terms and you do not have any authority of any kind to bind VoceSpace in any respect whatsoever. Except as expressly set forth in the section above regarding the Apple Application, you and VoceSpace agree there are no third party beneficiaries intended under these Terms.
